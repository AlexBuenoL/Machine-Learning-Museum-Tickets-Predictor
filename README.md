# Museum Attendance Prediction in Barcelona

This repository contains Python code for visualizing dataset information and comparing regression models to predict the number of visitors to museums in Barcelona for the upcoming week. The goal is to analyze the dataset, create informative visualizations, and evaluate the performance of different regression techniques for accurate predictions.

Museums are important cultural and educational hubs, and predicting their attendance can aid in better resource management and planning. Using historical data, this project explores:

Data visualization: Insights into historical attendance trends.
Model comparison: Evaluation of various regression models to identify the best predictor.
Features
Dataset Exploration: Visualizations to understand attendance trends, seasonal patterns, and other factors affecting visitor counts.
Regression Models: Comparison of multiple regression algorithms, such as:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge regression
- Lasso regression
  
Performance Metrics: Evaluation of models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
